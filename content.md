Title: Robbie
Subtitle: Junior Full-Stack Developer

Hi there, I'm Robbie

Ever since 2008, I have been teaching young musicians how to read, write and play music, especially the piano. But it wasn't until 2022 that I began my coding journey and fell in love with javascript and the potential of the web. Since then, I have been on a trajectory of learning about all things tech and building new things to experiment. I love the creativity that comes with code.

Outside of work, I like to play video games with friends, work on my own projects, play the piano or spend time with my birds.

I was a private music educator, with a passion for writing my own music and playing the piano. I grew up playing many instruments and decided that would be the path my life takes.

That was before I discovered programming.

I fell instantly in love with Javascript and have been learning a variety of different technologies for the web ever since 2022. I love how creative I can be with code and the remarkable places it can take us.

In my free time, I like to play games on my computer, play with my birds or have a hit of tennis.

## Projects

### Elder Scrolls Online Alchemy app

Your trusty alchemy assistant for the world of Tamriel!

In early 2023, I learnt the basics of ReactJS and decided to take something I was passionate about and create something that helped me enjoy it. The ESO Alchemy app is the product of that inspiration and helps serve me when I play ESO. Making use of components, hooks, and plain old logic, I was able to replicate the in-game alchemy system in the browser.

Begin mixing!
