Hi there, I'm Robbie

Ever since 2008, I have been teaching young musicians how to read, write and play music, especially the piano. But it wasn't until 2022 that I began my coding journey and fell in love with javascript and the potential of the web. Since then, I have been on a trajectory of learning about all things tech and building new things to experiment. I love the creativity that comes with code.

Outside of work, I like to play video games with friends, work on my own projects, play the piano or spend time with my birds.

## Projects

### Elder Scrolls Online Alchemy app

Your trusty alchemy assistant for the world of Tamriel!

In early 2023, I learnt the basics of ReactJS and decided to take something I was passionate about and create something that helped me enjoy it. The ESO Alchemy app is the product of that inspiration and helps serve me when I play ESO. Making use of components, hooks, and plain old logic, I was able to replicate the in-game alchemy system in the browser.

Begin mixing!
