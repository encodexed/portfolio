# Portfolio

Hello there, this is my portfolio page's repository. You can view the code behind the site and check its history.

## About Me (from page)

I was a private music educator, with a passion for writing my own music and playing the piano. I grew up playing many
instruments and decided that would be the path my life takes.

That was before I discovered programming.

I fell instantly in love with Javascript and have been learning a variety of different technologies for the web ever since 2022. I love how creative I can be with code and the remarkable places it can take us.

In my free time, I like to play games on my computer, play with my birds or have a hit of tennis.

## Technologies used in portfolio
